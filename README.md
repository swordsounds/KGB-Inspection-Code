# KGB-Inspection-Code
Code repository holding all KGB Inspection Systems code for various operatable and developing ROV's.

Please follow coding patterns for better documentation:
- Type Annotations
- Keep functions small 
- No more than 3 levels of nested if statements
- Use indentations to group respective statements

I will provide further documentation in a google doc/juptyer notebook when it's ready.
